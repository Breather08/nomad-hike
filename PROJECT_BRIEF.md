## Project Impact
This app addresses a real safety need in Kazakhstan's growing adventure tourism market. The design should inspire confidence for outdoor adventures while prioritizing user safety above all else. Think "professional outdoor guide" rather than "social fitness tracker."

The platform has potential for significant impact - both in growing Kazakhstan's tourism industry and preventing outdoor emergencies through better planning and safety features.
